Have you every wanted to generate geometric structures from data.frames, but independant of any R classes, attributes or libraries? 

No? Ok, this library isn't for you.

But if you answered 'yes', this might be of interest.

```{r}

library(Rcpp)

cppFunction(
  depends = "geometries"
  , includes = '#include "geometries/shapes/shapes.hpp"'
  , code = '
    SEXP polygon( SEXP df, SEXP geometry_cols, SEXP line_id ) {
      return geometries::shapes::get_listMat( df, geometry_cols, line_id );
    }
  '
)

df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10
  , y = 10:1
  , z = 21:30
  , m = 30:21
  , val = letters[1:10]
  , id = c( rep(1,5), rep(2,5) )
)

polygon( df, c("x","y"), c("id") )


```
